Uninstall the older version before installing the latest version to avoid having multiple installations.

2. Locate the older version of **GIMP**.

3. Click **Uninstall** and complete the removal process.

4. Download the latest version from the official website:


5. Run the installer and follow the installation steps.

## Note

* Your custom brushes, plugins, and preferences are stored in your user profile and are not removed when uninstalling the application.
* If both versions were installed using different methods (for example, Microsoft Store and standalone installer), uninstall the version you do not intend to use.
