# Comment out lines

Use the default keyboard shortcuts to comment code.

## Steps

1. To add or remove a single-line comment, press:

    ```
    Ctrl + Q
    ```

2. To add or remove a block comment, press:

    ```
    Ctrl + Shift + Q
    ```

## Note

`Cmd + /` is commonly used to toggle comments in editors such as Visual Studio Code and Sublime Text, but it is not the default shortcut in Notepad++.
