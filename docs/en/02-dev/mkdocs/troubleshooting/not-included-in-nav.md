# Fix "The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not included in “nav” configuration:"

```bash title="terminal"
The following pages exist in the docs directory, 
but are not included in “nav” configuration:
  - en/tools/docker/docker_troubleshoot_01.md
  - ja/labor/index.md
```
No fix is needed.

You should only care if you expect the page to appear in the menu but it doesn’t.
