## Notes

* GitHub will automatically redirect old repository URLs to the new name.
* However, you should update any local clones to avoid relying on redirects.

To update your local repository remote URL, run:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/NEW-REPOSITORY-NAME.git
```
